### Handling Tailwind Styles with TinyMCE Content  

In this project, I encountered an issue where **Tailwind's default styles** were overriding the content created in **TinyMCE**, causing it to appear inconsistent. To fix this, I used the **`@tailwindcss/typography`** plugin and applied the **`prose`** class. This class ensures proper styling for headings, paragraphs, lists, and other rich-text elements, allowing the content to display exactly as intended.
